# Welcome to the healthsites code base!

Healthsites is a framework for capturing, publishing and sharing critical
health and sanitation related data to help make these facilities more
accessible and relevant to the communities they serve. Our framework does not
limit our endeavours to these domains and in the future we plan to support
additional domains where it is helpful in humanitarian work.

**Please note that this project is in the early phase of its development.**

You can visit a running instance of healthsites at [healthsites.io](http://healthsites.io).

# Setup instructions

**Note** we provide alternative setup instructions for deployment and development under docker - see our [developer documentation](https://github.com/healthsites/healthsites/blob/develop/README-dev.md) for complete details. If you want to develop locally without using docker, follow the steps below.

### Check out the source


First checkout out the source tree:

```
git clone git://github.com/healthsites/healthsites.git
```

### Install dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-virtualenv
```

```
cd healthsites
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS-dev.txt
nodeenv -p --node=0.10.31
npm -g install yuglify
```

### Create your dev profile



```
cd django_project/core/settings
cp dev_dodobas.py dev_${USER}.py
```

Now edit dev_<your username> setting your database connection details as
needed. We assume you have created a postgres (with postgis extentions)
database somewhere that you can use for your development work. See
[http://postgis.net/install/](http://postgis.net/install/) for details on doing
that.

### Running collect and migrate static

Prepare your database and static resources by doing this:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd django_project
export RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
python manage.py migrate --settings=core.settings.dev_${USER}
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --settings=core.settings.dev_${USER}
```
