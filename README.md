Healthsites is a framework for capturing, publishing and sharing critical
health and sanitation related data to help make these facilities more
accessible and relevant to the communities they serve. Our framework does not
limit our endeavours to these domains and in the future we plan to support
additional domains where it is helpful in humanitarian work.

**Please note that this project is in the early phase of its development.**

You can visit a running instance of healthsites at [healthsites.io](http://healthsites.io).
